"""Scaling of ngio's own algorithms.

Reported as a series so the *shape* is visible: one timing cannot tell O(n)
from O(n^2), three can.

This is the one block that must reach into private modules -- it measures
internal algorithms, which have no public entry point. Those imports stay
inside `run` so that inside an environment holding a version where the paths
differ, this block degrades to a note rather than failing the run.
