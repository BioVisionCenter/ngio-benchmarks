"""Pyramid consolidation: which mode should I use, and will it fit?

`numpy` materialises a whole level (plus the zoom output twice, via
`_stacked_zoom`), so its peak tracks the data and it has a hard ceiling. `dask`
and `coarsen` are chunk-bounded and stay roughly flat as the data grows. That
difference is invisible in a timing -- `numpy` is also the fastest -- which is
why peak memory is a first-class column here and not an extra.
